This python executable can generate any specified number of BMP image given the program has the below available resources:
* colorIndex_std: is a color palette for non-skin layers
* skinIndex_std: is a color palette for skin layers
* folder named "BMPs": holds skeleton of layers with some special color indicating where color can be swapped out

This tool can make many unique images in an organized way. The tool is somewhat limited in the structure a person could generate a project.

* pip install colorama
